# DataScienceProjects
Hello Everyone🎉🎉
This is my first repository with collation of all the data science and python projects I have completed for courses and self-learning. 
Many of these projects provide a quick outlook for examples of usage of many data science and data manipulation libraries in Python.
Here I will add a brief overview of what you can find in each file (I know some of them are too long 😁)

1. Visualization using Matplotlib- SFO Library Usage Analysis
  - You will find various examples of building plots using matplotlib library, I really enjoyed working on this project because it gives a greater control on your objects.
  - With many other libraries like seaborn and plotly available, this may look basic, but believe me you can really design the chart in your own way without having to
  - be okay with the available views
  
2. Web Scraping - Data Visualization - Prediction - LinkedIn
  - First part includes Web Scraping using Selenium for LinkedIn Website. 
    - LinkedIn is just an example here, you can use this approach to apply for any public website available.
    - Try not to rerun the code as is, beacuse it needs your credentials to login to the site - I have just added **** in userid and password.
    - Also, if you need to scrape from famous websites, make sure you do not hit the run button too many times as may get locked out (I did by the way 🤣)
  - Second part includes text mining, extraction and visualization. 
    - You will find good examples of extracting required data from unstructured text and into columns for analysis.
    - There are very good examples of using seaborn for visualization (very fancy views 🎇) 
  - Feature Engineering
    - Term Frequency - Inverse Document Frequency
    - Cosine Similarity
    - PCA
    - K-means
  - Predictions using Random Forest
    - Feature importances
    - Hyperparamater Tuning
    - Grid Search Cross Validation
    - Confusion Matrix for results
  - NOTE: This is my own idea of searching jobs, while building algorithms on searching jobs 😂. And this was built a couple of months ago, so there may be better ways
  to acheive the same things. And importantly, the future scope of this project is very bright🎆, meaning there are many things we can do to take it further.
